WLAN RSS-based Indoor Localization and Tracking Algorithms using Field Data

This is a course project for ECS 257 Wireless Networks in UC Davis, 2013 Winter, originally presented by Wenhao Wu and Kun Wang on March 22nd. We proposed a HMM-based indoor localization and tracking algorithm by making use of theuserâ€™s speed information and the floor plan constraint. We also applied the Spectral Graph Partitioning algorithm to analyze the RSS data, which is from my course project for ECS 231 Scientific Computation. The floor plan and RSS data are acquired from http://www.crawdad.org/meta.php?name=cu/rssi

This repository contains the report, slide and the Matlab scripts for this project. You are especially encouraged to play with the GUI part!
